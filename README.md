An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.  This app is created to help a person view an employee directory.   The user can search by name in the search bar, and it will dynamically create the list of the search every time a letter is entered.   All of the columns in the app can be sorted both ascending and descending.
